TJLStack
========

A simple implementation of a Stack data structure using LIFO ordering.

<h2>Installation</h2>
<hr>
[Cocoapods](http://www.cocoapods.org) support is forthcoming, so in the meantime just grab the Source folder, drop it into your project and then import "TJLStack.h" wherever you need it.
<h2>Usage</h2>
<hr>
`+ new`<br>
`- push:`<br>
`- pop`<br>
`- toArray`<br>

That is most of what you need. Fast Enumeration is also supported.
